    "### Pick the model profile\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the first step in Bayesian inference is specifying a **full probability model** for the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **likelihood function(s)** for the observations\n",
    "- **Priors** for all unknown quantities\n",
    "\n",
    "The measurements look approximately normal (gaussian), so, as good statisticians, let's start by **assuming a normal distribution as the sampling distribution (likelihood) for the data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is the most common approach to building a Bayesian model: Get the histogram, see if it looks like Poisson, Normal, Exponential, or a bunch of other analytic pdfs (like the Beta and Gamma distributions), and try to fit the data to a model of the distribution by varying the distribution's paramter(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "So we pick a **Normal distribution**, which is described by its two paramaters $\\mu$ (mean) and $\\sigma$ (standard deviation):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_i \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that **Normal** and **Gaussian** is the same thing because Gaussian distributions are the most *normal*! They are the prettiest data imaginable!\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have 2 unknowns in the model so far: the **mean** and **standard deviation** of the likelihood. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we SWAG (**S**illy **W**ild-**A**ss **G**uess) our *priors*. We will model them as **probability density functions**, too!\n",

    "How do we choose pdfs for parameters $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$? \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discrete vs continuous values\n",
    "- The support of the variable\n",
    "- The available prior information\n",
    "\n",
    "While there may likely be prior information about the distribution of radon values, we will assume ***no prior knowledge*** (about the priors), and specify a **diffuse** prior for each parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the mean can take any real value (since it is on the log scale), we will use ***another normal distribution*** here, and specify a *large* variance, $10^2$, to allow the possibility of very large or very small values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu \\sim N(0, 10^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the standard deviation, we know that the true value must be positive (no negative variances!). Let's choose a [**uniform**](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/UniformDistribution.html) pdf prior, bounded from below at zero and from above at a value that is sure to be higher than any plausible value the true standard deviation (on the log scale) could take. That way, we are sure to capture the real value, somewhere in -between.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma \\sim U(0, 10)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that I picked 0 as the mean for the pdf of the model parameters. That is a common practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now encode these in a Python model, using the `PyMC3` library."

    "Bayesian programming is called ***probabilistic programming***, and it is probabilistic in that we create probability models using programming variables as the model's components. Model components are first-class primitives within Bayesian libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    ">   Another way of thinking about this: unlike a traditional program, which only runs in the forward directions, a probabilistic program is run in both the forward and backward direction. It runs forward to compute consequences of assumptions it contains about the model, but also backward from the data to constrain possible explanations. In practice, many probabilistic programming systems will cleverly interleave forward and backward operations to efficiently home in on the best explanations.  - [Cronin, Beau. \"Why Probabilistic Programming Matters.\" 24 Mar 2013. Google, Online Posting to Google . Web. 24 Mar. 2013]( https://plus.google.com/u/0/107971134877020469960/posts/KpeRdJKR6Z1)\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Bayesian Software\n",
    "> There is a good amount of software options for Bayesians, including both open source software (*e.g.*, [Stan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_(software)), PyMC3, JAGS, emcee) and commercial (*e.g.*, SAS, Stata). Your instructor happens to love `PyMC3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyMC3 is a Python library for programming Bayesian analysis; see [here](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.55). It's a  wonderful package. Looky [here](https://docs.pymc.io/) for its API and docs. It helps us solve tough inverse problems and extract a model from the data. We will use its `Metropolis()` and `NUTS()` APIs most often, and we'll even tinker with the Metropolis algorithm next week.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will model our radon dataset using PyMC3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "PyMC3 used to rely on [**theano**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theano_(software), a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently, and which we will revisit when we focus on machine learning. Theano is the brainchild of [Yoshua Benjio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio) of the University of Montreal's [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/) laboratory. In my opinion, it's the most famous university lab associated to artificial neural networks and deep learning. It's pretty [well-funded](http://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/en/article/2017/09/15/facebook-invests-over-7m-u.s.-in-mila-and-ai-research-in-montreal/).\n",
    "\n",
    "`theano` is slowly being deprecated because other libraries like facebook's `Torch` and Google's `TensorFlow` now include the same features. Old PyMC3 versions still uses theano, but the newer versions don't, they use [**tensorflow**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow) instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "`theano` is notorious in that it is often difficult to install, especially on the Mac. One option is to run the notebook on the Cloud, or to use `Sampyl` instead of `PyMC3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For probabilistic programming, you write a program in Python that builds expressions for Theano. You still have to declare variables $a,b,c$ and give their types $(int, int, int)$, build expressions for how to put those variables together, like $a^b + c$, and compile expression graphs to functions $Pow(a,b,c)$ in order to use them for computation. What theano builds in return is a super-fast callable object from a purely symbolic graph, optimizes the graph, and even compiles some or all of it into native machine instructions. More on Theano [here](http://www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/). \n",
    "\n",
    "For older theano versions of PyMC3 (don't do this if you're using a new version of PyMC3):\n",
    "- On Windows, from the Start menu, search for and open `Anaconda Prompt`. On MacOS, open Launchpad, then click the Terminal icon. On Linux, open a Terminal window. Now in these windows, type `conda install -c mila-udem theano pygpu`. Wait until success. Then in that same terminal, type `conda install pymc3`. Wait until success.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyMC3 code is easy to read. The only novel thing should be the syntax. Simply remember that we are representing the model's components ($\\tau, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$ ) as **probabilistic variables**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then execute the following cell. We name our model and define our priors as the pdf's we mentionned above. Notice priors are most often given greek variable names. The parameters for the priors (the parameters for the parameters of our model, also sometimes called *hyperparameters*) were really just silly guesses, and you have to learn to start with good guesses. That speeds up convergence *a lot*.\n",

    "What is the probability that a given household has a log-radon measurement larger than one? To answer this, we make use of the **posterior predictive distribution**.\n",

    "$$p(z \\;| \\; y) = \\int_{\\theta} p(z \\;| \\; \\theta) p(\\theta \\; | \\; y) d\\theta$$\n",

    "\n",
    "The posterior predictive distribution accounts for uncertainty about $\\theta$. We should refrain from plugging in a single best estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$ for $\\theta$, because it ignores uncertainty about $\\theta$, and because a source of uncertainty is ignored, the predicted distribution will be too narrow (extreme values of $\\tilde {x}$ will occur more often than the posterior distribution suggests).\n",
    "\n",
    "The posterior distribution of possible $\\theta$ values depends on $\\mathbf {X}$: $p(\\theta \\; | \\; \\mathbf {X} )$. And the posterior predictive distribution for any new datapoint $\\tilde {x}$ given $\\mathbf {X}$ is calculated by marginalizing the distribution of $\\tilde {x}$ given $\\theta$ over the posterior distribution of $\\theta$ given $ \\mathbf {X}$. That is the integral above. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_predictive_distribution) for more explanation.\n",

This involves generating simulated data using the model that you built, and comparing that data to the observed data. We did not do this, but you should earmark a certain percentage of your data just for testing (and not use it for training or modeling).\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The most difficult part of Bayesian estimation is the part that models the parameters of the pdf you picked as your model ***as pdfs themselves***. You might think that it's picking the right statistical profile that matches the histogram of the dataset, but that's usually not that hard. Picking the shape of the pdf for each model parameter is harder because you don't have a physical profile to match! And then, you also need to pick initial conditions for these parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's all about experience! If you ***make the right choices*** (and that is often the *art* behind Bayesian inference), then Bayesian packages like `PyMc3` will do all the work for you, and you will get a good **model** of your dataset, and then you can throw away all the historical data and use that model to do predictions. If you make the *wrong choice*, most often your computation won't converge or you will get very strange results. In which case, go watch an episode of GoT, then start from scratch."
